#### v1.0.0

**Initial Version**

WASM binding to libmagic, 100% javascript, provides an interface that mimics the libmagic C API. A type-safe more abstracted interface will be added in the next release.

**Features**

- Get a descriptive string of the file contents
- Get the mime type and mime encoding of a file
- Optimized loading of the magic file for multiple calls to the API or uses from multiple threads (e.g. WebWorker)
